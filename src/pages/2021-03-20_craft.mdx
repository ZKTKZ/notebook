# Craft is surprisingly good

I first stumbled across [Craft](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127?uo=4) in spring 2020, when they were in beta—the focus seemed to be on “beautiful documents,” I tried it briefly but dismissed it. In December, when it won [MacStories Selects’ Best New App](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2020-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#craft), I took another look. It was useful to [listen to how the MacStories team uses](https://appstories.net/episodes/197/) the app, & I set it up.

It’s quickly become an important part of my workflow, bringing a remarkable balance of design, deep functionality, & a native, responsive interface across my iPhone, iPad, & Mac.

## Note-taking flip-flopping

I started using [Evernote](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/evernote-notes-organizer/id281796108?uo=4) back in 2010, & since then I’ve tried a ton of note-taking apps over the years;
a few of my favorites have been [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447?uo=4) & [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4) (which I still use as a text editor), but I’ve tried the hyperpopular [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as well. For school, [I use GoodNotes](https://notebook-dm9xkjt7u.vercel.app/2019-12-02_how_i_take_notes_for_college/).

In December 2019 [I wrote about my systems, concluding with Apple Notes](https://notebook-dm9xkjt7u.vercel.app/2019-12-02_switching_from_bear_to_apple_notes/). Since then, I’ve been using Apple Notes daily for most of my note-taking, as well as light project management & occasional writing.

## Apple Notes setup

Apple Notes has been one of my favorite productivity tools ever. Besides traditional notes, there’s 4 main ways I’ve been using it:

1. Working docs. These are continually-edited documents about processes in my life, like how I download transactions/process finances. These are never done unless they’re no longer relevant; I’m regularly re-visiting them to add to & edit.
2. Logs. These are folders or notes I exclusively append to, typically with links. I have Products (notes like “iPad stands,” “Wallets,” “Desks” with lots of links in them), Design/Code/Links (where I save links I might want to search for), Ideas (what it says on the tin).
3. Lightweight project management. Working on a small-ish website project, I’ll have one note for the whole thing, where I have various sections, small to-do lists, ideas jotted down, links to packages I might use saved.
4. Reference. Gift card codes, product serial numbers, non-sensitive health records, the like. That folder stays small, as I want to dig these out quickly.

While it looks super simple on the outside, one of my favorite parts of Apple Notes is its Share extension. It lets you pick a note to append to instead of creating a new one; I use this a ton for my Logs & the project notes. In addition, Apple Notes has, as I [recently wrote](https://notebook.lachlanjc.com/2021-01-14_ipados_14_is_the_best_digital_handwriting_yet/), the best integration with Apple Pencil of nearly any app: being able to draw/write anywhere is liberating, as well as copy it as text via OCR anytime. The sync is flawless, the collaboration is stripped-down but enough, it’s easy to add checklists, tables, files, & images.

One of my favorite of its features is Instant Notes: You can tap the iPad display while it’s off with the Apple Pencil to immediately launch a new note for sketching or handwriting, without even unlocking. No other app can do that, including Craft.[^1]

[^1]: Unless you never use Apple Notes & set up a Shortcuts Automation to open your notes app when Apple Notes opens, but I’m not a big fan of such automations, as I always end up wanting the original app sometimes.

## Enter Craft

Craft offers nearly everything Apple Notes does & goes far beyond, while managing to feel even faster. There’s 4 features in particular I love.

1. Double-sided **note links**. In any document, type <kbd>@</kbd> & start searching for the name of your note, & a live link to the note’s name gets inserted. On that note’s page, Craft shows backlinks.
2. **Cards, nesting, & grouping**. In Apple Notes, sections easily overflow; in Craft, you can swipe to select a few blocks, then group them into a card, which can be edited as a full note inside, or become its own separate document. Any line of text can have nested content, but unlike Notion, nesting doesn’t add complexity you can never escape in a sidebar, it lives purely inside the document. Cards can be styled in fun ways, which I took advantage of while planning the content & design of my [2020 Sites](https://2020-sites.lachlanjc.com) project:

3. **Blocks**-based editor. Being able to reorganize a note by dragging elements around seamlessly, without selecting blocks of text & relying on cut/paste, reduces commitment to the original structure while I’m writing evolving notes. Pasting a URL turns into a rich bookmark (unlike Apple Notes, which requires the Share extension for this functionality).
4. **Sharing notes as links**. [Here’s](https://www.craft.do/s/aHLtwIvRXa85La) a recent blog post I wrote in Craft.

Craft has a Share extension similar to Apple Notes, bea

## A note on Notion

Comparing Craft to Notion is certainly the elephant in the room. I’ve used Notion pretty extensively, & while it’s undeniably incredibly flexible, it feels like making a [“better” tool for tools’ sake](https://museapp.com/podcast/7-from-prototype-to-product/). It‘s seemingly made for people who only use MacBooks with Google Chrome 24/7. Though [in October](https://twitter.com/notionhq/status/1317209961940676608?s=21) Notion’s iPad app began supporting basic features like selecting multiple lines of text (only with an external input device), if you’re primarily using iOS devices, Notion is perpetually uninspired, hamstrung, & disappointing.

**Craft, meanwhile, sings.** Though it doesn’t have Notion’s remarkably powerful databases, the interface is what Notion wishes it ever could be. It’s fast, fluid, uses gestures, is native on every Apple platform. The iPhone app has every feature built for touch; the iPad app feels designed 100% for trackpad & keyboard input; the Mac app, [built on Catalyst](https://www.craft.do/maccatalyst-guide), adapted perfectly. It’s perfectly responsive to your touch or any other input device.

I’ve mentioned Craft’s speed several times. Speed is a critical factor in creative tools to me, & one where Notion undeniably falls down. As Craig Mod says, “[fast software, the best software](https://craigmod.com/essays/fast_software/).”

There’s dozens of little touches I love. If you open a new paragraph of text but don’t type anything, when you dismiss the keyboard, the new paragraph closes itself. Like Notion, if you have a link on the clipboard, select text & Cmd-V to hyperlink it. On iPhone, there’s a gradient from the top edge of the screen the status bar rests on, so your content recedes gracefully & the status bar remains readable. But if you leave edit mode & scroll down, all the UI hides itself, leaving you to read your document with no obstruction, taking beautiful advantage of the recent edge-to-edge displays.

And while Notion ostensibly uses Markdown, in practice it feels incredibly distant from any sort of plain text. Craft similarly obscures the plain text syntax into a modern, rich UI, but it feels very connected to the text itself. When you export a document from Notion

Link bookmarks deserve a special shout-out.
