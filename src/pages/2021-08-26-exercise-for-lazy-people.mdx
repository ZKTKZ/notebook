# Exercise for Lazy People
You don't *have* to go to the gym. [^1]


[5 minutes of exercise](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/)(especially when it is high-intensity) is much better than 0 minutes of exercise.

It is not a linear curve.


Build pockets of fitness into your space. This lets you be healthy without thinking. No willpower needed.

Here are a few toys to get you started::
- Yoga mat rug ($40) [^2]
- Balance board ($30)
- Skipping rope (N/A)

If you are frugal, you can still get by.

For 24 hours, use only your legs to turn lights on/off. I recommend wall dips[https://medium.com/parkouredu/parkour-strength-training-for-beginners-949e961129b9] with the cabinet for upper-body strength.

You'll have to make adjustments based on what kind of space you're in.  I live in an apartment, so I can't build a rock climbing wall in my garage. I also can't keep the pullup bar in my doorway overnight.[^3].

[^2]: I love this yoga mat. It can pass off as a rug. It also ~~doubles~~ triples as a prayer mat. It may also be the gateway to a Shopify shop.
