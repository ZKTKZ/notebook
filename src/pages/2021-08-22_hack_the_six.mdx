# 6 Lessons from Hack the 6ix

<img src={AtomImage} alt="Adam holding an atom " />

### 1. How to go idea to IDE in 5 seconds
**Spoiler**: This only works for JavaScript applications.
https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing

### 2. How to have fun with React Native
*Hint**: use utility props.
https://docs.nativebase.io/
Here's what our app looks like

### 3. Make your pitch deck before the event [^1]
90% of the deck is about the problem anyway.

You are telling a story about the user.

It's about the problem. The solution can come later.

### 4. Team is #1 - Thielogists 
<img src={FlowImage} alt="Is this flow?" />

Who you work with is more important than what you work on. [^2]

I don't regret working with my team. They're cool people. It was occasionally stressful [^3], but we shipped a mostly functional thing.


But it would be stupid if I expected to win. Our mobile developer started learning React Native at 1AM on Saturday night. Our machine learning developer lives in India. Our designer didn't exist. [^4]


Working with strangers can lead to serendipidity.

But when you're trying to make an app (from scratch) in 36 hours against a 100 other teams? It's not a formula for winning.


### 5. Discord threads solve its biggest problems
Lists don't work for social media. [^5]

You're having a discussion about the Dalai Llama.

You leave for an hour. You're back, but the messages have stopped making sense. You try to scroll up. But all you see is emoji: ðŸ¦™ðŸ¦™ðŸ¦™ðŸ¦™ðŸ¦™

Threads solve this problem. Every message is a tree, and trees are made for tangents.

### 6. Logitech MX Vertical is the RSI killer I need
6 months ago, I couldn't use a mouse for longer than a Pomodoro without moderate pain.

At Hack the 6ix, I spent 18 hours coding and 6 hours sleeping over a 36 hour window.




I should use a stacked bar chart to illustrate this.

When I woke up the first morning, my side ached. But my hands were fine.


A Logitech MX Vertical is not a Deux Ex Machina.

I do some (albeit light) exercise semi-regularly (if overloading your writing with qualifiers doesn't qualify you to offer unsolicited advice, I don't know what does!). I do yoga every (other) day (with Adrienne)[https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene][^9]. I perch myself atop the balance board for a few minutes. These have certainly helped me become manage my pain.

I've experimented with many kinds of pain killers. Killers for the body and killers for the mind.

I'll put a blank space here as a marker to come back and fill in the gaps.

I found The Mindbody Prescription to be effective. In my case, there was no prescription. I found it over-the-internet.

The Mindbody Prescription has very positive reviews on Amazon. Stories of living with chronic pain for years, and then becoming healthy after reading this book. I was sold by the reviews. 

I wasn't sure that it would work, but I was ready to give it a shot. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placebo


This could be selective memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_memory_biases) - I may be (unwittingly) overemphasizing the effects to support my narrative.

Let's talk about the mouse. It cost me $150 CAD. That's a lot of money. See if your employer can cover it. If you're a student, look for grants. Or email Logitech for a discount. Or if you really must, buy it from Amazon. 



Bonus: looks that kill
Logitech have good designers. Logitech's keyboard for the iPad is also great. It could almost pass for Apple.

I love the design. I lack the [design vocabulary](https://www.amazon.ca/Design-Everyday-Things-Revised-Expanded-ebook/dp/B00E257T6C/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=) to do it justice. 

@Twitter, What are some other well-designed mice?



[^1]: What else is perfectly ok to do ahead of time in hackathons (but few people do?)?

[^2]: And what you work on is more important than who you work with

[^3]: Stress is the kind of thing that reflects more on the recipient than the donor

[^4]: That's a 10 hour timezone difference. 10 hours is also the number of hours you can use Colab's GPUs for free

[^5]: It takes O(n) to search for things. Discord has a search bar. But searching is a pain.

[^6] This is a [well-documented](https://mindingourway.com/failing-with-abandon/) bug in the human behaviour algorithm. We use `if` statements for habits. This is because a binary decision tree is easier.   

[^7]: I love this yoga mat. It can pass off as a rug. It also ~~doubles~~ triples as a prayer mat. It may also be the gateway to a Shopify shop.
[^8]:  This is not ideal because people are lazy and one extra step can make or break the difference when you're trying to [form a habit](https://www.amazon.ca/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1)
[^9]: Habits are hard. That's why I just do the yoga of the day on this [super helpful calendar](https://yogawithadriene.com/calendar/)
