# About

### ðŸš€ I'm on a journey to redefine my potential

In Grade 7, I failed my math exam.

In Grade 11, I got an A in AP Calculus.

I'm only getting started.

### ðŸŒ± I want to create real value.

<details><summary>I have an eclectic background. I spent high school making prose, memes, and sticky notes. </summary>
<p>

I had the opportunity to be an executive at clubs that received **$8000** grants and were recognized as Ontario's Best High School Newspaper by the Toronto Star. As much as I enjoyed social work - holding doors at 8AM in the morning, wheeling a cart of food waste to school because my landlords wouldn't let us compost - creating large scale value requires more than intention.

<p>
To make things.  
<ul>
<li> At Dropbase (YC W20), I worked on a product with 25000+ installs and scaled it to support 25X concurrent usage </li>
<li> At Unyte Health, my first job, I had to debug obscure SQL bugs on launch day while our team lead was away </li>
</ul>
