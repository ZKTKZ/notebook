# üçë Organic Exercise

Do you want to be fit but hate exercise? ‚õ≥Ô∏è
Still reading despite the red flag?

### Why not just go to the gym?

Here are the 4 fundamental forces in the universe, ranked in order of strength:

- Gravity
- Electromagnetism
- Weak force
- Strong force
- Friction

Friction is what keeps you from being a normal functioning member of society

Habits are hard.


Skipping a day is a slippery slope. 

(wait, isn't friction supposed to help with that)

Is this you?
1. have a gym membership
2. skip one day 
3. decide that you are now fated to skip forever

### Exercise for every environment

Build pockets of fitness into your space. 
This lets you be healthy without thinking. 
No willpower needed.

Here are a few ideas:
- Yoga mat rug ($40) [^2]
- Balance board ($30)
- Skipping rope (N/A)

You'll have to make adjustments based on what kind of space you're in.  
I live in an apartment, so I can't build a rock climbing wall. 
I can't keep the pullup bar in my doorway overnight. [^3]

### Are 5 minutes of exercise really that better than none? 
That's a leading question, but yes.


The benefits of exercise are non-linear. 

The benefits of exercise are compounding.


[5 minutes of high-intensity exercise](https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/the-scientific-7-minute-workout/)(especially when it is high-intensity) is vastly better than none.


### Bonus: Red Flags and Red Herrings
Math is fun.
